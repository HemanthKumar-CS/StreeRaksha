StreeRaksha: AI & IoT-Powered Women Safety Analytics

Executive Summary
-----------------
StreeRaksha is an innovative, AI-driven platform designed to proactively enhance women’s safety in public spaces. 
By combining real-time computer vision, machine learning, and affordable IoT edge devices, StreeRaksha delivers instant threat detection and actionable alerts to authorities—empowering rapid, data-driven responses and smarter city safety management.

The Problem
-----------
Despite widespread CCTV coverage, most surveillance systems are reactive—providing evidence only after an incident has occurred. 
Women, especially in high-risk zones or during late hours, remain vulnerable due to delayed detection and response. 
There is a critical need for a proactive, intelligent system that can identify threats in real time and enable immediate intervention.

The Solution: StreeRaksha
-------------------------
StreeRaksha transforms public safety by deploying AI-powered analytics directly at the edge (using Raspberry Pi 5 devices) and integrating with a secure, real-time dashboard for authorities. 
The platform’s core strengths:

- Real-Time Threat Detection:
  • Uses advanced computer vision (YOLO, MediaPipe, MobileNetV2) to analyze live CCTV feeds.
  • Detects gender, crowd density, distress gestures, and abnormal movements.

- Edge AI for Privacy & Speed:
  • Raspberry Pi 5 nodes process video and sensor data locally, sending only relevant alerts and evidence to the cloud.
  • Reduces bandwidth, preserves privacy, and ensures low-latency detection.

- Authority Dashboard & Incident Management:
  • Secure, dashboard for real-time alert visualization, live feed monitoring, and incident analytics.
  • Interactive map displays incident locations and risk zones for rapid resource deployment.
  • Comprehensive incident logging and analytics for pattern recognition and strategic planning.

- Intelligent Alert System & Evidence Collection:
  • Automated, multi-channel notifications (dashboard, push) for redundancy and reliability.
  • Secure storage of image frames and sensor data as verifiable evidence.

- Predictive Safety Analytics:
  • Risk heatmaps and trend analysis help authorities identify high-risk zones and optimize patrols.
  • Data-driven resource planning for smarter, safer cities.
