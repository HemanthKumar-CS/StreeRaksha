# StreeRaksha - AI & IoT-Powered Women Safety Analytics

## 1. Introduction

**StreeRaksha** is an advanced AI and IoT-powered platform dedicated to enhancing women’s safety in public spaces. By leveraging real-time computer vision, machine learning, and edge IoT devices (such as Raspberry Pi), StreeRaksha analyzes live CCTV feeds and sensor data to detect potential threats and instantly alert authorities through a secure dashboard. This proactive system aims to prevent incidents before escalation, enabling rapid response and data-driven decision-making for law enforcement and security agencies.

### Problem Statement

Women often face safety challenges in public areas, particularly in high-risk zones or during late hours. Conventional surveillance systems are largely reactive, providing evidence only after incidents occur. StreeRaksha bridges this gap by delivering real-time, intelligent threat detection and immediate notifications to authorities, empowering them to intervene swiftly and effectively.

## 2. Core Features

StreeRaksha’s architecture is built around four core modules, each designed to address a critical aspect of public safety:

### 2.1 Real-Time Threat Detection (AI + IoT)

- **AI-Powered Video Analysis**: Continuously monitors live CCTV and edge camera feeds using state-of-the-art computer vision models.
- **IoT Edge Devices**: Raspberry Pi 5 nodes process video and sensor data locally, ensuring low-latency detection and privacy preservation.
- **Detection Parameters**:
  - Gender classification to identify women in the scene.
  - Crowd density analysis to detect potentially unsafe situations (e.g., a lone woman surrounded by a group).
  - Recognition of distress gestures and abnormal movements (e.g., raised hands, frantic motions).
  - Identification of women in isolated or high-risk areas, especially during nighttime.
  - Environmental context from sensors (lighting, sound, motion).
- **Parallel Processing**: Enables rapid, simultaneous analysis of multiple video streams for real-time response.

### 2.2 Authority Dashboard & Incident Management

- **Real-Time Alerts**: Instantly notifies authorities of detected threats with supporting evidence (images, sensor data).
- **Live Feed Monitoring**: Secure access to live CCTV and edge device footage for real-time assessment.
- **Incident Logging & Analytics**: Maintains a comprehensive record of alerts, detections, and responses for review and pattern analysis.
- **Interactive Map Visualization**: Displays incident locations and risk zones to assist in resource allocation and rapid deployment.
- **Incident Response Workflow**:
  - Visualizes alerts on an interactive map.
  - Notifies nearby law enforcement for immediate intervention.
  - Logs actions taken and outcomes for accountability and future strategy.

### 2.3 Intelligent Alert System & Evidence Collection

- **Automated Alerts**: Generates and dispatches real-time notifications to security personnel and authorities upon threat detection.
- **Evidence Storage**: Captures and securely stores image frames and sensor data as verifiable proof for investigations and legal proceedings.
- **Multi-Channel Communication**: Supports notifications via dashboard, SMS, and other secure channels for redundancy and reliability.

### 2.4 Predictive Safety Analytics (For Authorities)

- **Risk Heatmaps**: Aggregates historical incident data to identify and visualize high-risk zones and time periods.
- **Trend Analysis**: Provides insights into recurring patterns, enabling authorities to optimize patrols and preventive measures.
- **Resource Planning**: Assists in strategic deployment of security resources based on data-driven risk assessments.

## 3. IoT-Based Approach: Smart Edge Surveillance Nodes

StreeRaksha deploys Raspberry Pi 5 devices as **smart surveillance nodes** at strategic public locations. Each node operates as follows:

- **Live Video & Sensor Capture**: Continuously captures video and environmental sensor data (lighting, sound, motion).
- **On-Device AI Analysis**: Runs lightweight, optimized models locally for immediate threat detection.
- **Edge Processing & Privacy**: Processes sensitive data on-device, transmitting only relevant alerts and evidence to the central platform.
- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Sends alerts with supporting evidence to the authority dashboard upon detection.
- **Centralized Monitoring & Response**: Integrates with the main platform for coordinated, city-wide monitoring and rapid response.
